  === Island Adventure ===

  Salt stings your lips as you come to on Wreck Beach, a sand-scratched canvas
  backpack digging into your shoulder like the last proof you're still alive.
  You crawled onto Wreck Beach with a battered pack and salt-stung lungs
  No rescue is coming. The island is littered with rusted crates, broken
  masts, and half-hidden traps that look older than the tides. Every scrap you
  salvage buys another hour above the undertow.

_ 
      Wreck Beach The golden sands of Wreck Beach stretch invitingly, dotted
  with remnants of past adventures and whispers of the ocean's secrets.
  Items:

  - Rags
      Exits: EAST, NORTH, SOUTH

_ 
  You poke around and stir up dust, but find nothing useful.

_ 
  Rags: Salt-crusted, torn cloth strips -- perfect for wrapping a torch head
  and soaking fuel.

_ 
  Tidepool Rocks
  The Tidepool Rocks stretch out like ancient sentinels, their weathered
  surfaces glistening in the sun, inviting explorers to uncover the secrets
  hidden within the shimmering pools below.
  Exits: EAST, NORTH, SOUTH, WEST

  You are the detective in the Hall.
  You chased the Coldwater killer for a decade; every witness ended up
  swallowed by the same mansion. Tonight the owner invited you in, promising
  the house will "talk" if you listen.

  itself behind you. The floorplan shifts like it resents your footprints. You
  have one night to pry the truth out before the house keeps you, too.

  along the walls, whispering secrets of the past and inviting curious

  The Iron Rattler hisses at the platform; the payroll strongbox must be
  secured before sundown, and someone has wired Rattlesnake Bridge with TNT.
  You once rode with the Iron Rattler gang; now Dry Gulch pays you to keep it
  alive. A payroll strongbox rolls in with the dusk train, and so do old
  partners carrying fresh dynamite and older grudges.
  The bridge is creaking, the telegraph is cut, and the sheriff's badge is on
  your chest for one night only. Save the strongbox, keep the bridge intact,
  and get the train out before sundown closes the deal.

  Neon drips off wet Kowloon streets; retrieve the Jade Capsule before the
  harbor handoff.
  1970 Hong Kong: humidity, neon, triads, and three-letter agencies tripping
  over each other in back alleys. You are off-book, tasked to intercept the
  Jade Capsule before it moves across the harbor.
  The Capsule is said to carry the WOPR drive schematics--proof that someone
  intends to light a global fuse. Rival spooks, smugglers, and local crews are
  all hunting it; your only edge is getting there first.
  Safehouses burn fast, phones click with taps, and the harbor timetable is
  tightening by the minute. The Capsule's courier changes routes when spooked,
  so every alley clue matters.

_ 
  Nathan Road Neon Canyon
  Neon stacks climb like cliffs. The sidewalk is a moving river of shoulders,
  reflections, and flickering characters. Listening, you catch tram bells and
  a low-high-low taxi horn motif repeating in the hum.
  Exits: EAST, NORTH, SOUTH

_ 
  You poke around and stir up dust, but find nothing useful.

_ 
  Flicker Sign Stack
  One vertical sign sputters in a steady rhythm. The "wrong" strokes look
  intentional, like a code.
  Exits: EAST, NORTH, SOUTH, WEST

_ 
  You scour the area; tracks point EAST.

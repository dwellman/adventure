Run log for manual and scripted game playthroughs.

| Date | Game | Mode | Start (local) | End (local) | Runtime | Outcome | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-12-25 | Spy Adventure | 1980 | 2025-12-25 19:29:34 -0700 | 2025-12-25 20:30:40 -0700 | 1h 1m 6s | Incomplete | Could not obtain the Jade Capsule (take/open failed). Multiple described fixtures were not interactable (postbox slot, Lantern Shrine latch, Gate Mouth phrase); Courtyard Exit Rail latch never accepted input; references to a shard/tile shard with no item present. Transcript captured via `screen` hardcopy (local `/tmp/spy1980.log`, not committed). |
| 2025-12-25 | Island Adventure | 1980 | 2025-12-25 20:40:34 -0700 | 2025-12-25 21:09:38 -0700 | 0h 29m 4s | Incomplete | Lit torch crafting works (torch -> soaked torch -> lit torch), but taking the Time Stone resets the day and clears inventory. Bamboo poles appear after using the hatchet in Bamboo Forest, then the day resets immediately, wiping progress. Parachute requires dropping starting items to fit; taking vine rope without bananas kills the player. Transcript captured via `screen` hardcopy (local `/tmp/island1980.log`, not committed). |
| 2025-12-25 | Mansion Adventure | 1980 | 2025-12-25 21:10:13 -0700 | 2025-12-25 21:29:57 -0700 | 0h 19m 44s | Incomplete | Case Board `use` provides no actionable output, and there is no obvious accuse/solve flow. Inventory capacity blocks clue pickups (Ink Note, Knife) without warning and no pack capacity readout. Some fixtures are described as open (trophy case) but `open` responses still feel inconsistent. Transcript captured via `screen` hardcopy (local `/tmp/mansion1980.log`, not committed). |
| 2025-12-25 | Western Adventure | 1980 | 2025-12-25 21:30:33 -0700 | 2025-12-25 21:45:09 -0700 | 0h 14m 36s | Lost (sundown) | Wire cutters on bridge charges report "nothing happens" but then confirm success, suggesting conflicting messaging. Telegraph console ignores wire cutters. Train departed/bridge exploded while exploring; unclear required sequence to secure strongbox + signal before sundown. Transcript captured via `screen` hardcopy (local `/tmp/western1980.log`, not committed). |

# Daily Log — 2025-12-26

## What I touched
- Added a 4x4 dungeon adventure minigame with a combat encounter for integration testing.
- Added a dungeon playbook (YAML/MD) and wired it into the minigame integration suite.
- Gated the integrity test behind an explicit flag so the default suite skips the long run.
- Updated Mansion and Western playbooks to enforce full win paths (no early exit), aligned win expectations with trigger output, and relaxed quit requirements for win outcomes in playbook tests.
- Captured 1980 win transcripts for Island, Mansion, and Western; updated the scoreboard with win outcomes and runtimes.
- Ran the full integrity sweep with the opt-in flag and refreshed the testing strategy verification date.
- Ran the full test suite.
- Captured a scripted 1980 win for Spy Adventure and logged the transcript/scoreboard entry.
- Moved root-level docs into `docs/`, added a logs hub, and consolidated AI/CLI runbooks into `docs/howto/runbooks/`.
- Moved the Island test-only game bundle into `src/test/resources/games/` and repointed Island playbooks to it.
- Added a shared adventure playbook test harness and refit the four adventure playbook integration tests to use it.
- Reorganized AI runtime/authoring and engine runtime packages, and standardized the Spy game id/path.
- Added architecture/games/glossary/ADR docs, runbook index, and package-info summaries for core packages.
- Added workspace-level PROCESS.md in the parent directory with Java/Markdown standards.
- Fixed SmartActorRuntimeTest compile error, updated trimLines to count non-empty lines, and aligned exit casing with Direction long names.
- Tightened GamePlan CLI YAML key validation and fixed ListRendererTest null-list setup.

## Notes / Risks
- Combat output depends on deterministic dice rolls; the minigame tests pin rolls to max.
- Integrity checks now require `-DrunIntegrity=true` (or `RUN_INTEGRITY=true`) to execute.
- Island 1980 win requires waiting at Wreck Beach to satisfy the 600-tick gate (scripted turns).

## Tests / Evidence
- `mvn -q -Dtest=MiniGamePlaybookIntegrationTest test`
- `mvn -q -Dtest=GameIntegrityTest test`
- `mvn -q -Dtest=MansionAdventurePlaybookIntegrationTest,WesternAdventurePlaybookIntegrationTest test`

- `mvn -q test`
- `mvn -q -Dtest=SmartActorRuntimeTest test`
- `mvn -q -Dtest=GamePlanCliTest,ListRendererTest test`
- Not run (docs + package-info updates only).
- Not run (workspace-level documentation only).

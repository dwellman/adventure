# Daily Log — 2025-12-20

## What I touched
- Added a command AST/compiler/interpreter pipeline and wired GameCli to use it for parsing.
- Added command compiler tests covering directions, look targets, craft/how, quoted strings, and unknown input.
- Added DSL design spec doc with GDL/GEL/PIL grammar and gap analysis; updated docs index.
- Expanded GEL scanner/compiler/evaluator for arithmetic, unary minus, attribute access, and structured error results.
- Updated GEL tests for scanner tokens, compiler AST, evaluation semantics, and failure cases.
- Disallowed nested function calls in GEL compiler and updated DSL gap list accordingly.
- Wired registry-backed attribute resolution with strict/fallback policy controls and added resolver tests.
- Added GDL scanner/parser/compiler scaffolding with GameSave output and GDL compiler tests.

## Notes / Risks
- Command parsing behavior remains aligned with existing CLI rules; new AST is the entry point for future grammar expansion.
- DSL spec is ASCII-normalized; add emoji back only if desired for formatting.

## Tests / Evidence
- `mvn -q -Dtest=CommandCompilerTest test`
- `mvn -q -Dtest=KeyExpressionScannerTest,KeyExpressionCompilerTest,KeyExpressionEvaluatorTest test`
- `mvn -q -Dtest=GdlCompilerTest test`

## Next
- Align any downstream consumers to the new Maven coordinates (`com.demo.adventure:adventure:0.1.0`).
- Review prompt README and narrator prompt for remaining AI polish.

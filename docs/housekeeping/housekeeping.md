Last verified: 2025-12-21 (Codex — deep clean sweep)

The shared housekeeping playbook lives at:

/Users/dwellman/workspace/unna/shared-instructions/housekeeping.md

Local notes:
- Log cleanup sweeps in `docs/housekeeping/cleaning.log`.
- Use `docs/housekeeping/deep-clean.md` + `docs/housekeeping/clean-log.md` for deep clean scope, protocol, and logging.
- Update `docs/bujo/daily/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` and `docs/journal.md` with scope, commands, risks, and follow-ups.

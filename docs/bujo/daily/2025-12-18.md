# Daily Log — 2025-12-18

## What I touched
- Adopted BUJO structure (docs/bujo, daily log) and journal hook for this repo.
- Hardened AI config: property-driven model/temperature/top_p/logprobs for translator/narrator.
- Consolidated CLI wrappers via a shared Maven helper; fixed structured game menu path and YAML quoting issues.
- Added structured game load test for all menu entries; ran full test suite; regenerated IDEA project files.

## Notes / Risks
- Keep future prompt edits generic and in sync with `application.properties` defaults to avoid drift across games.
- IDEA regeneration may overwrite local project tweaks; re-apply custom IDE settings if needed.

## Tests / Evidence
- `mvn -q test`

## Next
- Align any downstream consumers to the new Maven coordinates (`com.demo.adventure:adventure:0.1.0`).
- Review prompt README and narrator prompt for remaining AI polish.

# Daily Log — 2026-01-02

## What I touched
- Moved the GDL demo fixture into test resources and updated CLI/runtime tests to use the new path.
- Updated storybook notes and the games index to reflect the test-only GDL demo location.
- Renamed cookbook YAMLs to the `gardened-<game>` pattern and updated docs/tests/examples.
- Fixed README paths for world/narrative layouts and corrected the Western poster heading.
- Split GameRuntime into runtime helpers (scene, inventory, conversation, emote+dice) and delegated behavior.
- Split GameIntegrityCheck into simulation/key-expression helpers with shared label utilities and updated tests.
- Split KeyExpressionEvaluatorTest into focused scanner/evaluator/attribute tests with shared helpers.
- Extracted SmartActorRuntime snapshot/command resolver helpers and integrity simulation action/state helpers.
- Extracted key-expression spec/AST/validator helpers from integrity checks.
- Split GameRuntime combat/use logic into RuntimeCombat/RuntimeItemUse and extracted SmartActorHistoryRecorder.
- Added win-requirement evaluation helper with focused tests.
- Extracted explore/open/put into RuntimeCommandActions and added combat edge-case tests.
- Split navigation + trigger handling into RuntimeNavigation/RuntimeTriggers with delegated move/turn/reset flow.
- Moved game catalog + footprint rules + crafting defaults into YAML with new loaders and CLI/runtime wiring.
- Replaced Java sample games with YAML loads in tests/utilities and removed the sample classes.
- Updated playbook harness + CLI crafting test to use the new catalog entry and YAML recipes.

## Notes / Risks
- GDL demo no longer ships in main resources; runtime docs or menus should not assume it exists.
- Cookbook filenames changed; any external scripts must use the new `gardened-<game>.yaml` names.
- GameRuntime now delegates behavior to helpers; watch for any state sync regressions.
- SmartActorRuntime keeps test-only wrappers for reflection-based coverage of command/trim helpers.
- Combat flow now delegates to RuntimeCombat; ensure encounter state stays in sync across resets.
- Command actions now delegate to RuntimeCommandActions; watch for open/explore regressions.
- Navigation/trigger flow now delegates to helpers; watch for gate messaging or turn-advance regressions.
- Game catalog and footprint rules now load from YAML; ensure index/resources ship with builds.

## Next
- [ ] Validate narration continuity once RECENT_ACTIONS has real player data.
- [ ] Add/update narration service tests for direction-specific grounding edge cases.
- [ ] Verify fallback narration reads as a rewrite (not raw snapshot) on grounding failure.
- [ ] Review grounding tolerance with real LLM outputs and tune thresholds if needed.

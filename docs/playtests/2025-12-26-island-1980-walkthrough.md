  === Island Adventure ===

  Salt stings your lips as you come to on Wreck Beach, a sand-scratched canvas
  backpack digging into your shoulder like the last proof you’re still alive.

  No rescue is coming. The island is littered with rusted crates, broken
  masts, and half-hidden traps that look older than the tides. Every scrap you
  salvage buys another hour above the undertow.

  At first light you shove off. The raft catches the wind and the reef falls
  away. Scratch stands beside you, no longer a ghost, the missing letter in
  his hand. Behind you the volcano flares with a sharp green flash as the
  island folds and vanishes. You escape.

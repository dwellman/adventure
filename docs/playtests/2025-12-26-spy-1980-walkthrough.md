  Neon drips off wet Kowloon streets; retrieve the Jade Capsule before the
  harbor handoff.
  1970 Hong Kong: humidity, neon, triads, and three-letter agencies tripping
  over each other in back alleys. You are off-book, tasked to intercept the
  Jade Capsule before it moves across the harbor.
  The Capsule is said to carry the WOPR drive schematics—proof that someone
  intends to light a global fuse. Rival spooks, smugglers, and local crews are
  all hunting it; your only edge is getting there first.
  Safehouses burn fast, phones click with taps, and the harbor timetable is
  tightening by the minute. The Capsule’s courier changes routes when spooked,
  so every alley clue matters.

_ 
  Nathan Road Neon Canyon
  Neon stacks climb like cliffs. The sidewalk is a moving river of shoulders,
  reflections, and flickering characters. Listening, you catch tram bells and
  a low-high-low taxi horn motif repeating in the hum.
  Exits: EAST, NORTH, SOUTH

_ 
  Flicker Sign Stack
  One vertical sign sputters in a steady rhythm. The “wrong” strokes look
  intentional, like a code.
  Exits: EAST, NORTH, SOUTH, WEST

_ 
      Harbor Promenade Rail Walk The harbor opens wide and loud. Ferries cut
  wakes like drawn lines across a dark board. Fixtures:

  • Harbor Rail
      Items:

  • Harbor Schedule
      You see:

  • Dockmaster Lin
      Exits: EAST, NORTH, SOUTH, WEST

_ 
  You take the Harbor Schedule.

_ 
  Boarding Bell Line
  A bell rings sharp and clean. The crowd surges forward, and a handoff could
  happen without anyone noticing.
  Exits: EAST, NORTH, WEST

_ 
  Turnstile Sightline Posters
  Posters face the queue at precise angles. From one spot, their corner marks
  align into a symbol.
  Exits: EAST, NORTH, SOUTH, WEST

_ 
  Queue Position Posts
  Posts divide the line into lanes. Small placards show numbers that skip in a
  pattern.
  Exits: EAST, NORTH, SOUTH, WEST

_ 
      Ferry Ticket Token Window Tickets slide out with a soft slap. The clerk
  taps the counter twice for some customers and once for others. Fixtures:

      Items:

  • Ferry Token
      Exits: EAST, NORTH, SOUTH, WEST

_ 
  You take the Ferry Token.

_ 
      Gate Mouth Phrase Check The entry is narrow and watched. People pass
  only after a short exchange that sounds like nonsense. Fixtures:

  • Phrase Check
      Exits: EAST, NORTH, SOUTH, WEST

_ 
  Bottle-Glass Wall Bend
  Glass shards set in mortar glitter along a bend. The shards form a line that
  points like an arrow.
  Exits: EAST, NORTH, SOUTH, WEST

_ 
      Alley Mirror Board Small mirrors hang on a board to “see behind you.”
  One mirror is angled to reflect a specific sign far away. Fixtures:

  • Mirror Board
      Items:

  • Alley Drop Card
      Exits: EAST, NORTH, WEST

_ 
  You take the Alley Drop Card.

_ 
  Toy Spinner Vendor
  Bright spinners blur into circles. The colors settle into a repeating order
  if you stop staring and start counting.
  Exits: EAST, NORTH, SOUTH, WEST

_ 
      Street Map Kiosk A laminated map is creased from use. Someone has
  circled an area with a blunt pencil and then scratched it out. Fixtures:

  • Case Handler
      Exits: EAST, NORTH, SOUTH, WEST

_ 
  Side Path Mini Buddhas
  Smaller figures line a short path. Counting only the “different” ones yields
  a checksum, not a digit.
  Exits: EAST, NORTH, SOUTH, WEST

_ 
      Courtyard Corner Shrine A small corner shrine holds the final shard. It
  is hidden where respectful hands naturally avoid touching. Fixtures:

  • Shrine
      Items:

  • Shard
      Exits: EAST, NORTH, SOUTH, WEST

  letters are scraped in places, revealing hidden characters. Fixtures:

  shown only in the reflection.
  Exits: EAST, NORTH, SOUTH, WEST

_ 
  The latch releases and the Jade Capsule rests cold in your palm. You ghost
  away before the harbor handoff. Mission complete.

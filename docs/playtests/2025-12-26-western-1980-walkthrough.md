  The Iron Rattler hisses at the platform; the payroll strongbox must be
  secured before sundown, and someone has wired Rattlesnake Bridge with TNT.
  You once rode with the Iron Rattler gang; now Dry Gulch pays you to keep it
  alive. A payroll strongbox rolls in with the dusk train, and so do old
  partners carrying fresh dynamite and older grudges.
  The bridge is creaking, the telegraph is cut, and the sheriff's badge is on
  your chest for one night only. Save the strongbox, keep the bridge intact,
  and get the train out before sundown closes the deal.

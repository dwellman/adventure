# Runbooks Index

Purpose: single index of operational runbooks and their intended use.

Runbooks:
- `docs/howto/runbooks/ai-cli.md` - authoritative AI/CLI runtime flow (translator -> engine -> narrator).
- `docs/howto/runbooks/testing-strategy.md` - test strategy and agent validation workflow.
- `docs/howto/runbooks/new-game-walkthrough.md` - end-to-end authoring walkthrough with acceptance checklist.

Conventions:
- Each runbook should declare purpose, inputs, outputs, and the tests to run.
- Changes to runbook behavior should be logged in BUJO and the journal.

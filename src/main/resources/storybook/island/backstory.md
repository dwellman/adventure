# Island Adventure – Backstory and World Definition

## 1. Core Premise

You wake on the shore of a strange island with a small backpack and no memory of how you arrived.

The island only has **one day**.

There is no real past or future here, only **today** repeating. When you die, the day resets, the island resets, and everything returns to its starting state.

You remember.
The island does not.

Your goal is simple:

> **Build a raft and escape before the 24-hour clock runs out.**

The only way to truly “end the day” is to leave the island alive.

---

## 2. Time, Loops, and the Green Motif

### 2.1 The Loop

- The island is locked in a repeating **24-hour cycle**.
- When the player dies:
  - Time resets to the start of the day.
  - The island returns to its initial state.
  - The player **remembers** previous loops.
  - The **notebook** in the backpack persists with all prior notes.

There is no clear in-world explanation given for the loop. It may be tied to the **Time Stone**, the island itself, or something older, but this is never fully confirmed.

### 2.2 The Digital Watch

The player has a modern **digital watch** in their backpack.

- **Normal state (before taking the Time Stone):**
  - Digits: **white**
  - The colon between hours and minutes blinks **green** at a slow, steady pace.
  - This is the only subtle hint that time is already “off” here.

- **Cursed state (after taking the Time Stone):**
  - The entire display flips to a **sick green**.
  - The colon blinks faster.
  - The countdown visibly accelerates.
  - No tutorial explains this; the watch itself communicates that something is wrong.

The watch always resets to its starting state at the beginning of each loop.

### 2.3 Green as a Time-Wound Signal

Green is used sparingly as a **danger / time-wound motif**:

- **Natural greens** (bamboo, leaves, bananas) are normal and safe.
- **Unnatural/vivid greens** are tied to time distortion or cursed elements:
  - Time Stone glow deep in the volcano.
  - Watch digits turning green when time speeds up.
  - A faint **green shimmer** around the ghost when he is still bound to the loop.
  - **Greenish-black spiders** in the cave after the web is burned.
  - Slightly unnatural **green moss** near the cave poem and map.
  - **Green-stained teeth** on the chaos monkeys.
  - The final **green flash** at the volcano’s peak when the island disappears.

### 2.4 The Green Flash

A real-world phenomenon is folded into the island’s logic:

- At rare times near dawn or dusk, a **green flash** can appear at the edge of the Sun due to atmospheric refraction.
- The scientist has a journal note explaining this in clinical terms:
  > The atmosphere behaves as a crude prism, bending the different colours of sunlight by slightly different amounts. Under very clear conditions, the last—or first—sliver of the solar disc can separate just enough that the green component is briefly visible on its own.  
  > I have seen such a flash at sea before, but here it comes from the mountain’s crown, not the horizon. That detail continues to trouble me.

- In the **final scene**, a powerful green flash erupts from the volcano as the island rushes off and vanishes. This visually ties the Stone, the island, and the time-wound together without explicit exposition.

---

## 3. Player Starting State

### 3.1 Location

- The player wakes **on the beach**, near where a raft can eventually be built and launched.

### 3.2 The Backpack

The player starts with a **small backpack**, unopened.

Inside:

1. **Digital watch**
2. **Dead iPad**
3. **Notebook**
4. **Pen**

Behavior:

- The backpack is the player’s only container.
- It has limited capacity, and the **iPad takes up critical space**.
- The player must decide whether to keep carrying useless tech or free space for survival items.

### 3.3 Persistent Notebook

The **notebook** is special:

- It **does not reset** with the loop.
- Everything the player writes in it persists across deaths and day resets.
- In-fiction, there is no detailed explanation; it is simply the one object that seems to “defy” the island’s rules of time.
- The notebook becomes the player’s **meta-save**:
  - Mapping routes.
  - Counting bananas.
  - Timing the wreck.
  - Tracking monkey behavior.

The player’s memory and the notebook together are how they learn to beat the loop.

---

## 4. Layers of History

### Player verbs (current CLI snapshot)
- Movement: `go <direction>` or shortcuts `n|s|e|w|ne|nw|se|sw|u|d`
- Scene: `look`/`listen`, `look <thing>`
- Inventory: `take <item>`, `drop <item>`, `inventory`
- Search: `search`/`explore` (may reveal hidden items or breadcrumbs)
- Crafting: `craft <item>`, `how craft <item>` (lists skill + ingredients; with no arg lists known recipes)
- Help/quit: `help`, `quit`

The island carries **multiple eras** at once. The loop blurs past, present, and future into one repeating “today.”

### 4.1 Pirates (Oldest, implied)

- Pirates reached the island long ago.
- They carved a **poem** and a **crude map** into the cave wall.
- Their writing looks **fresh** because the island resets:
  - The writing persists as part of the island’s repeating state.
  - The third line of the poem has been scratched out by a later hand.

#### Cave Poem (Incomplete, Pirate Voice)

On the wall:

> *Forged in the mountain’s fire and brine,*  
> *The Stone what bends the hours brings a fortune fit for kings.*  
> *— — — — — — — — — —*  *(deeply scratched out, unreadable)*  
> *And he who clutches it steps ahead o’ time.*

This poem tempts the reader with **power and wealth**, not warning. The critical danger line is the one that’s been scratched out.

#### Crude Pirate Map

On the opposite cave wall, a **knife-carved map** shows:

- A jagged triangle for the **volcano**, marked with a huge, aggressive **X** and text like:
  - “HEAT ’N GOLD”
  - “X MARKS TH’ SPOT”
- Fanged circle for the **cave**, with:
  - “SPIDERS GUARD WHAT BE FORGOTTEN”
- Vertical slashes for the **Bamboo Forest**, with a monkey skull doodle:
  - “DAMNED HAIRY THIEVES”
- A crooked shack on stilts for the **Treehouse**:
  - “POOR BASTARD’S ROOST”
- A long broken “metal bird” for the **plane wreck**:
  - “SKY-BEAST BONES”
- A short shoreline with a tiny raft icon:
  - “SWEET WIND OUT”

Many smaller Xs are scattered around as **false leads**, hinting at pirate rivalry and deliberate misdirection.

### 4.2 The Scientist – “Scratch” (1893)

A late-19th-century **scientist**, influenced by Darwin, comes to the island to observe strange species and phenomena.

- Year: **1893**
- He builds the **Treehouse** as an elevated observation post.
- He is the **skeleton** in the treehouse.
- He is fascinated by the monkeys, the spiders, and the island’s eerie regularities.
- He keeps a **scientific journal**, methodical, precise, and increasingly disturbed.

#### Example Journal Entry – Time and Atmosphere

> **22 June 1893**  
> Lacking a proper chronometer, I have resorted to marking the sun’s ascent with the sextant and my pocket scope. Yet even with such crude means, the pattern is too exact to ignore. The interval between first light and full sunrise has matched my estimates to the minute for five successive days. No drift. No variation.  
>  
> The air, too, remains in a curious equilibrium. No change in temperature of note. The same wind from the east each morning. No sign of seasonal shift in the foliage. The sky presents the same low scatter of clouds at nearly the same hour—though I hesitate to write “hour,” for I cannot be certain it is one.

#### Journal Note – Time Stone Lore

> **17 June 1893**  
> In the East India Company logbooks I examined in London, several captains describe a putative “Time Stone” buried in a volcanic isle, credited with arresting decay and prolonging a man’s life beyond its natural span. Since making landfall here, I have observed an unnerving regularity: the light, the tides, even the cries of the monkeys recur with a sameness that resists ordinary explanation. If such a Stone exists, it may not bestow longevity in the usual sense, but rather a kind of persistence without progression, in which life continues yet refuses to move on.

#### Final Journal Entry

At the end, as his sanity frays:

> **April 17**  
> Time doesn’t heal all wounds.  
> Time is the wound.  
> I’m going now.  
>  
> —S.

The **next page is missing**, torn cleanly from the journal.

#### The Missing Page

That missing page later appears in the **final scene**, as a love letter Scratch carries when he regains human form. It is not tragic, but hopeful: a promise he can finally deliver.

### 4.3 The Plane and Crew (1964)

In **1964**, a small survey plane encounters the island.

- Its instruments go haywire when entering the island’s airspace.
- The crew circles, unable to find a safe landing zone.
- They decide to **parachute in**, hoping to be picked up by a survey ship the next day.
- The island resets; the wreck remains pristine, trapped in the repeating day.

#### Letter in the Flight Jacket

Found in a crisp, unworn flight jacket:

> **June 3, 1964**  
>  
> If anyone finds this,  
>  
> We crossed into this island’s airspace about an hour ago, and the instruments went wild almost at once. Compass spinning, altimeter useless, panel clock jerking around, and the radio nothing but static.  
>  
> We’ve been circling in this little plane trying to find a place to set her down, but there’s not a clear stretch anywhere. We’re going to make one low pass and jump with the chutes. The charts say a survey ship should pass these coordinates at **0800 tomorrow**. If we can get a fire going, they ought to see it.  
>  
> Leaving this in case things go the other way.  
>  
> — Capt. J. H. Mercer

#### Crash Site Detail

Outside the wreck:

- Three shallow **impact depressions** in the ground, each human-sized.
- No bones. No fabric. No footprints.
- It is as if three people hit the ground and then **never made new marks** afterward.

Inside the wreck, **six seats** and **one remaining parachute** hint at a pattern:
- Six places.
- One chute.
- Five chaos monkeys now on the island.

This correlation is never confirmed, only implied.

---

## 5. Key Locations and Their Roles

There are five primary “elemental” sites plus the crash:

1. **Cave**
2. **Bamboo Forest**
3. **Treehouse**
4. **Monkey Grove**
5. **Volcano**
6. **Crashed Plane** (on the volcano’s leeward side)

### 5.1 Cave – Knowledge, Pirates, and Spiders

Features:

- A heavy **spider web** blocks the deep chamber.
- Behind it: the **pirate poem**, the **crude map**, and hints about the Time Stone.
- The rock near the writing shows **strange green moss** or mineral stain.
- After the web is burned, the **greenish-black spiders** relocate to guard the entrance.

Rules:

- The player needs a **fire source** to burn the web (exact implementation left for gameplay design: lighter from plane, flint on beach, etc.).
- Once the web is burned and the back chamber explored:
  - Returning later = **instant death** from the spiders, who now swarm the entrance.
- The cave back chamber looks like it was once used as a **camp**—a place to sleep that slowly became a prison, echoing the pirates’ fate.

Narrative Role:

- Introduces the **Time Stone myth** and **X marks the spot**.
- Gives a rough **map** of the island.
- Subtly links spiders, pirates, and the island’s curse.

### 5.2 Bamboo Forest – Wood and Bananas

Features:

- Dense stands of **straight bamboo**, ideal for raft construction.
- **Banana trees**, producing the monkeys’ favorite food.

Rules:

- The **hatchet** is required to cut usable bamboo poles.
- **Bananas** are needed to safely handle the monkeys later:
  - 5 monkeys → 5 bananas to fully feed them.

Narrative Role:

- Primary source of **raft frame material**.
- Source of **bananas** for the monkey puzzle.

### 5.3 Treehouse – Scratch’s Refuge, Hatchet, and Ghost

Features:

- A **dilapidated treehouse**, built high for observation.
- The **skeleton** of the scientist lies inside.
- His **journal** is scattered on a table with a sextant and a small scope.
- The final entry page remains; the next page has been torn out.

Rules:

- Moving the skeleton reveals a **hidden hatchet** under the body.
- Moving the skeleton also **releases the ghost**:
  - The ghost has a faint **green shimmer** along its edges.
  - This is Scratch, bound to the island by his understanding of the loop and the Stone.

Narrative Role:

- Provides **scientific interpretation** of the island’s anomalies.
- Supplies the **hatchet**, a critical tool for raft construction.
- Introduces Scratch as both past victim and future companion.

### 5.4 Monkey Grove – Vines and Chaos

Features:

- A **troop of five chaos monkeys** with **green-stained teeth**.
- They throw poo, steal items, and mimic the player’s gestures (“monkey see, monkey do”).
- They guard the **only vines strong enough** to lash the raft together.

Banana/Backpack Rule:

- There are **5 monkeys**.
- Each monkey needs **1 banana** to be fully fed and calm.
- The backpack’s capacity depends on the **iPad**:
  - With iPad: max bananas carried = **2**.
  - Without iPad: max bananas carried = **5**.

Monkey Encounter Outcomes:

- If the player has **5 bananas** and offers them all:
  - All monkeys are fed.
  - They allow safe access to the vines.
- If the player has **4 or fewer bananas**:
  - At least 2 monkeys go hungry.
  - The troop becomes enraged and **kills the player**.
  - Death triggers a loop reset.

Additional Behavior:

- After the vines are taken or the monkeys are engaged, they may begin to **wander the island**, acting as mobile chaos events, but their exact roaming behavior is left flexible for design.

Narrative Role:

- Forces the player to choose between **useless tech** (iPad) and survivability.
- Suggests something more human about the monkeys without confirming their origin.

### 5.5 Volcano – Time Stone and False Goal

Features:

- A climbable **volcanic peak**.
- Deep inside, the **Time Stone** rests—a gem with a **cold green glow**.

Time Stone Rules:

- **Not required** to escape.
- Taking the Stone:
  - Doubles the speed of the island’s 24-hour clock.
  - Turns the watch digits fully **green** and speeds up the blink.
  - Makes the game significantly harder but offers **no mechanical benefit**.
- The Stone is a **false treasure**:
  - It promises power and immortality.
  - In truth, it only deepens the time-wound.

Narrative Role:

- Embodies the central moral dilemma:
  - Chase power and legend, or quietly survive.
- Connects pirates, the scientist, the pilot, and the player through shared temptation.

### 5.6 Crashed Plane – Sail, Letter, and Turn Limit

Features:

- A small **survey plane** crashed on the volcano’s leeward slope.
- Inside:
  - Six seats.
  - One remaining **parachute** (usable as a sail).
  - The **pilot’s letter** in a green-toned flight jacket.
- Outside:
  - Three human-sized impact depressions in the ground, no remains.

Turn Logic in the Wreck:

- The game tracks consecutive turns **inside the wreck**:

  - **Turns 1–8:** Safe exploration.
  - **Turn 9:** The wreck shifts, loud creak, clear warning.
  - **Turn 10:**
    - If the player’s action is **EXIT WRECK**:
      - They step out safely.
      - The wreck immediately breaks free, rushes down the mountainside, over the cliff, into the ocean.
      - The wreck is gone for the rest of the loop.
    - If the player does **anything else** on turn 10 while inside:
      - The wreck breaks free **with them in it**.
      - They die in the crash.
      - The loop resets.

Narrative Role:

- Provides the **parachute** that becomes the raft’s sail.
- Anchors the **1964 layer** and ties into the green/time motif via the watch and atmospheric anomalies.
- Hints that the crew may have become something else (monkeys) without ever confirming it.

## 6. Raft Requirements and Escape Path

To truly escape the island, the player must assemble and launch a raft before the 24-hour loop ends.

### 6.1 Required Components

1. **Tool – Hatchet**
   - Source: Under the scientist’s skeleton in the **Treehouse**.
   - Use: Cutting bamboo and vines.

2. **Frame – Bamboo**
   - Source: **Bamboo Forest**.
   - Use: Main raft logs and crossbeams.
   - Requires hatchet.

3. **Lashings – Vines**
   - Source: **Monkey Grove**.
   - Use: Lashing bamboo into a stable raft.
   - Requires:
     - 5 bananas from Bamboo Forest.
     - Backpack capacity (must drop iPad).

4. **Sail – Parachute**
   - Source: **Crashed Plane**.
   - Use: Catching wind to leave the reef and reach open ocean.
   - Requires leaving the wreck before or on turn 10 inside.

5. **Knowledge – Cave Map and Poem**
   - Source: **Cave back chamber** behind the spider web.
   - Use: Rough orientation and mythic instructions.
   - Requires burning the web once and then never returning (post-burn cave is lethal).

### 6.2 High-Level Escape Sequence (One Possible Optimal Loop)

1. **Open backpack**, wear the watch, examine notebook, realize iPad is dead.
2. **Visit cave** early:
   - Burn web.
   - Read poem and map.
   - Learn of Stone and rough layout.
   - Never return after this trip (to avoid spider death).
3. **Reach Treehouse**:
   - Move skeleton.
   - Take hatchet.
   - Release Scratch as ghost.
4. **Go to Bamboo Forest**:
   - Cut bamboo with hatchet (enough for a “large” raft).
   - Gather 5 bananas.
5. **Drop the iPad** to free backpack capacity.
6. **Go to Monkey Grove**:
   - Feed all 5 monkeys with 5 bananas.
   - Safely collect vines.
7. **Climb to Plane Wreck**:
   - Explore inside (coat, letter, etc.).
   - Take parachute.
   - Leave wreck no later than turn 10 inside.
8. **Return to shore**:
   - Build raft with bamboo, vines, and parachute sail.
9. **Final Loop**:
   - Ensure Scratch’s arc is fulfilled (ghost to human on launch).
   - Launch raft at **sunrise**, with raft large enough for both of you.

The **Time Stone** is never actually required. Taking it only makes the clock run faster and turns the watch digits green—a tempting but punishing false goal.

---

## 7. The Ghost – Scratch

### 7.1 Identity

- Scratch is the **scientist’s ghost**.
- He is the skeleton in the Treehouse, and the ghost released when the body is moved.
- “Scratch” reflects:
  - His habit of **writing and scratching notes**.
  - The **scratched-out line** of the pirate poem.
  - His failure to write down the final truth.

### 7.2 Behavior

- Initially, he appears as a translucent figure with a **faint green shimmer** at the edges.
- He is tied to the island and the loop; he cannot leave in ghost form.
- He seems to half-remember prior loops, giving vague hints and fragments.
- As the player progresses toward the true escape:
  - His green shimmer fades.
  - He becomes more solid, more human.

### 7.3 The Torn Page and the Letter

- The missing journal page reappears as a **love letter** Scratch once wrote but never sent.
- In the **final ending**, when the raft successfully leaves the island with both the player and Scratch aboard, he appears fully human, holding the letter.
- He is **joyful**, not haunted:
  - He can finally give the letter to his girlfriend in the real world.
  - He is no longer bound to the repeating day.

---

## 8. Final Ending

This is the **last text** the player reads before “GAME OVER”.

> The raft rose and fell with the swell, its small sail catching the first light of sunrise. Scratch stood beside you, no longer a ghost but a living man, the missing page folded carefully in his hand.  
>  
> Behind you, the island shimmered. For a heartbeat it seemed to fold inward, then rush off toward the horizon, moving impossibly fast as if fleeing the coming day. From the crown of the volcano, a sudden green flash lit the sky—sharp, brilliant, and gone in an instant.  
>  
> Then the island was gone.  
>  
> Only open ocean remained, calm and bright, as if the place had never existed at all.  
>  
> Scratch let out a slow breath.  
> “It’s gone,” he said. “We’re free.”  
>  
> **GAME OVER**

The loop is broken.  
The day finally changes.  
And two people leave the island alive.

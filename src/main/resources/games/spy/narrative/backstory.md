1970 Hong Kong: humidity, neon, triads, and three-letter agencies tripping over each other in back alleys. You are off-book, tasked to intercept the Jade Capsule before it moves across the harbor.

Safehouses burn fast, phones click with taps, and the harbor timetable is tightening by the minute. The Capsule’s courier changes routes when spooked, so every alley clue matters.
